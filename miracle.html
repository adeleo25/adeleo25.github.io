		  <h2>Economic Reforms by the United States</h2>
		  <p style="margin-left:40px;margin-right:40px;text-indent:50px;font-size:16px">
			During the occupation of Japan, the United States indirectly controlled Japan by creating economic reforms. One goal for MacArthur was to demilitarize Japan. This goal was reached in the constitution of 1947. There was complete demilitarization along with seizing of military production. Many attribute this reform to being one of the reasons for the economic miracle. All the resources that were being put into the military were being spent in other ways. The government no longer had to spend money no an estimated 10% of the population that was in the army.

			The United States also broke apart the zaibatsu, or Japan business conglomerates. The zaibatsu would get preferential treatment through tax breaks and funds from the government. The holding companies were taken down with the Anti-Monopoly law and the Decentralization law. These conglomerates held monopoly over the markets, they funded and implemented policies that would hurt others and benefit them. The zaibatsu would smother labour unions, maintain relationships similar to those during feudal times, and harmed the Japanese middle class.

			The United States also implemented other policies such as land reform and labour democratization. Land reform essentially removed a class of landowners who owned arable farmland but did not farm it themselves. In addition, labour unions were allowed to form, partially due to the dissolution of the zaibatsu.
